> Simbad is a Java 3d robot simulator for scientific and educationnal purposes. It is mainly dedicated to researchers/programmers who want a simple basis for studying Situated Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and more generally AI algorithms, in the context of Autonomous Robotics and Autonomous Agents. It is not intented to provide a real world simulation and is kept voluntarily readable and simple.

### What about the game?

We have realized a Pong-like game using Simbad in a ten of hours for a university project.
The game supports up to 2 players and an AI can replace them if needed.

The game uses :
